# feedbook
Django REST Framework and Angular5 Integration

Feedbook uses Angular 5 on client side to communicate with Django REST Framework backend. Users create articles that 
other users can "like" and comment. The more liked and commented article is the higher it is positioned on main page.
For user authentication, backend server uses Jason Web Tokens.
